## What is "within reason" for an item?

"Within reason" means that the items stats are based on the level of the item itself. 

This is to prevent the game from becoming pay to win with donator weapons having damage ranges of e.g. 200 to 6,000 at level 5.

## What stats will my donator pet have?

The stats of a donator pet is typically matched to the users current level +10, with the stats getting a 20% boost to HP and damage.

Along with this, the user gets to choose the type of the pet aswell.
